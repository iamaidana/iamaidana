As every nature documentary lover knows - Sir David Attenborough is the true King of the Jungle. David Attenborough is a British naturalist and media personality best known for writing and presenting programs that have inspired the modern format of nature documentaries. 

I like watching all of his wildlife and nature documentaries. He is my favourite guy. I like that he gets to see lots of rare animals. He saw a bird that could make a noise like a chainsaw. His enthusiasm for wildlife in all its forms is very contagious: whether the organism is small or big, attractive or just very strange it doesn’t matter, he can tell you an intriguing story about it. I have picked up this enthusiasm and, every day, I’m amazed by the natural world.

<h3>What documentaries did David Attenborough make?</h3>

David Attenborough has produced, written, narrated or presented well over one hundred documentaries in his life. These are some stand-out examples, each pushing the boundaries of wildlife photography and cinematography.

  <li> <p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/be-en/title/80216393" title="hp">A Life On Our Planet</a></p>  
<p>By giving viewers a closer look at Attenborough’s travels throughout his 60-year career, A Life On Our Planet is as much about the changing natural world as it is about the man who documented it all. The film sees Attenborough reflect on the defining moments of his career as a naturalist and the effect that climate change is having on the areas he has visited throughout his career.</p>

<p>If you didn’t catch Attenborough’s Seven Worlds, One Planet series when it aired at the end of 2019, now’s the time to give it a watch. With each episode in the series dedicated to a different continent of the world, there’s plenty to learn. From the fireflies that populate the forests of Mississippi to the haunting song of the Sumatran rhino nestled in the tropical forests of the Himalayas, the careful detail of each episode in the Seven Worlds, One Planet series makes it a real treat to watch.</p>

  <li> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b006mywy/planet-earth" title="hp">Planet Earth</a></p>  
<p>Known for being one of Attenborough’s most iconic projects, Planet Earth was the most expensive nature documentary series ever commissioned by the BBC when it was released in 2006, and the first to be filmed in high definition. Filmed over four years across 64 different countries, each of the series’ 11 episodes features a different habitat on Earth, from the deep caves of Mexico to the unforgiving temperatures of Mongolia’s Gobi Desert.</p>

  <li> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p02544td/planet-earth-ii" title="hp">Planet Earth II</a></p>  
<p>Just when the world thought Planet Earth couldn’t be beaten, the BBC went and produced Planet Earth II. The first-ever series produced by the programmer in ultra-high definition, each episode of Planet Earth II sees Attenborough look at a different habitat and the animals fighting to survive there, from the peregrine falcons which hunt among New York City’s skyscrapers to the ninja frogs fighting off wasps in flooded forests.</p>

<p>Extinction: The Facts may deal with a particularly heavy subject matter, but that doesn’t make it any less worth watching. With a million species now at risk of extinction, this one-off film – which aired on the BBC earlier this year – sees Attenborough explore the impact such a massive loss of biodiversity could have on our lives, including how it could put us at greater risk of pandemic diseases in the future.</p>

<p>Since its release in 2019, Our Planet has attracted a cult following, won an Emmy and been the subject of critical acclaim – and it’s not hard to see why. With its incredible cinematography and fascinating narration, Our Planet gives viewers the opportunity to get up-close with creatures, habitats and systems from all over the world. Punctuated with reminders about what’s at stake due to climate change, Our Planet is a seriously eye-opening watch.</p>

<p>Unlike some of his other documentaries, Frozen Planet sees Attenborough focus his attention on a particular area of the planet – the Arctic and Antarctic. Throughout the seven-part series, Attenborough and his team explore how the polar regions transform throughout the year, and how the animals who live there are equipped to survive the harshest of habitats. </p>
