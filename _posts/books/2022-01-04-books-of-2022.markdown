Happy New Reading Year 2022! There’s something very exciting about a fresh reading year to me – not in the least because of the fact that I can put together a new list of books I want to read that year!

The books on this list are my top priority for the year and I view them as the books that I have to read, no matter what. I usually choose books based on my current mood, but there’s actually one general rule: after every fiction book read a non-fiction one.

Last year, there were quite a few books on the list that were pretty light-read. This year, I’ve decided to do the same and add a couple of easy-read books. Obviously, the list will be updated from time to time.
