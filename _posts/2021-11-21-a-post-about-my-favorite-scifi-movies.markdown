I have always been interested in science - you could find me reading encyclopedias, trying to fix things or to find logic behind things. Another part of me is a bid daydreamer - imagining new realities, parallel universes, time distortions. Therefore, there is no surprise that one of my favorite cinema genres would be sci-fi.

What is sci-fi? According to wikipedia: science fiction (sometimes shortened to sci-fi or SF) is a genre of speculative fiction that typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. One may find sci-fi a pure human imagination; however, when scientifically accurate, sci-fi narratives help to legitimate some research fields among the public opinion. Sci-fi has inspired many technological innovations. Its influence is present in the invention, conceptualization, design and application of interfaces and technology. As an avenue of creativity and expression both, sci-fi literature and media have fueled advancements in interactive technology and proven to be a key source of inspiration for researchers in the field of computing technology.

What I like about this genre is that sci-fi has the power to blow, bend, and boggle the strongest of minds. If movies exist to immerse us in a world different than our own, science fiction exists to push the boundaries of our imagination by possibilities for what the future of our planet may hold, for better or for worse. If youâ€™re a huge admirer of science fiction like me, then here is list of my top sci-fi movies and tv shows.
