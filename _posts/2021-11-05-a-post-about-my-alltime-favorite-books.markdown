Since I love books so much, I thought I would share some of my all-time favorites in this post. For majority of the books I vaguely remember the characters or certain details, but I rate my books on Goodreads as soon as I’m done so I can at least remember if I liked it or not.  

I usually read at night right before sleep so I eagerly wait till the end of the day to open my Kindle. There is nothing better than getting lost in a story, and I enjoy finishing a book that has captivated me for days (or weeks, or in some cases months).
