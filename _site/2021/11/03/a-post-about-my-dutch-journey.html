    <p>Before moving to Belgium I worried a lot about learning Dutch. I started using Duolingo app to learn the basics and right pronunciation. I moved to Antwerpen in June this year and to my surprise the pronunciation was different due to the fact that they speak Flemish here. Nevertheless, learning the language is required! Here is my experience learning Dutch/Flemish so far.</p>

<h2>Why I Need to Learn Dutch</h2>

<p>My husband is fluent in English and that’s the language we converse in, however, to communicate with local people Dutch would really help. Secondly, since I’m a foreigner living in Belgium I am required to take an integration course called <em>Inburgering</em>. As part of the course completion there is a language portion incorporating listening, reading and writing in which I am to be tested on and pass at a 1.2 level. Lastly, knowing Dutch is very much needed to get a job here.</p>

<p>Two months ago I was enrolled into my first official Dutch class. I gave an entry exam and was eligible to enroll into level 3. This language journey of mine has just started.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Learn Dutch</h2>

<h3>It is easier for English speakers</h3>

<p>Believe it or not but Dutch is not too far off from English, in fact it’s pretty close since it stems from the Germanic family. In the English language there are many Dutch words that we use. Here are a couple Dutch words that the English language has borrowed and you may have not noticed:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Boss</td>
      <td>Baas</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Good</td>
      <td>Goed</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
      <td>Landscape</td>
      <td>Landschap</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
      <td>Cookie</td>
      <td>Kookje</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>To better understand the culture</h3>

<p>I think one of the best ways to learn about a language is through its culture. Memorizing the dictionary and knowing all grammar rules is good but you probably won’t find that useful when speaking to people on the street or communicating with natives. There are respective mannerisms, social skills and even humor that you can learn through the language and better help you connect with the culture.</p>

<h3>To improve your CV</h3>

<p>I don’t know about you but I’m always trying to sharpen my language skills to improve my CV. Especially with living in Europe where most people speak an average of 2-3 languages. While there are alot of English speaking companies there are more that prefer you to speak Dutch. And frankly, most companies would prefer a multilingual candidate or one who was at least attempting to learn the language.</p>

<h3>To make new friends</h3>

<p>In Belgium almost all the local population speaks English. Because of this expats and foreigners have the misconception that learning the language is not required. Learning the language of the country you’re in will help ease making connections with others. There is a door of trust and understanding that is opened and thus friendships and relationships are possible.</p>

<h2>What Has Helped Me in Learning Dutch</h2>

<h3>Dutch classes</h3>

<p>I went from saying key phrases to being able to express my opinion and my emotions in level 3. While I do think language is also a bit of a personal process taking a class can really compliment your journey. In my class we had frequent group activities which really pushed me out of my comfort zone but eventually made me comfortable enough to speak with others in Dutch.</p>

<h3>Language apps</h3>

<p>This is by the far the easiest and most fun way to get in some language learning. I could be on my phone reading the news or texting a friend and remember that I can spend 5-10 minutes on Duolingo app and learn some new vocabulary words. Try setting a daily timer to keep yourself more accountable! I am pretty commited to this app and currently am on my 2185 day streak.</p>

<h3>Dutch meetups</h3>

<p>There are plenty Facebook groups where language enthousiasts plan to meet in cafes/bars to converse in Dutch. People with different language levels are welcome. This is a great way not only to practice your Dutch but also to meet new people.</p>
